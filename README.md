Example to setup a monorepo

Thoughts:
- There is a bit of duplicated settings because of configuring the cache
- `test` and `build` should be two different jobs.
  - Because something fails to pass the `tests` doesn't mean it fails to `build`.
  - They should both be dependant on the same cache.
  - This means they should have a dependant job that restores the cache or installs the dependencies.
  - If there is no dependant job, the `test` and `build` job will have a cache conflict, and return a `warning`. See Footnote #1.
  - This also means that `test` and `build` are both downloading dependencies at the same time.
- Nice to have: see if the failures happen during download.
  - Though this could be figured out if examining the steps.
- Having an `install`/`download` job adds a few more additional seconds to the runtime.
- You decide what trade off you want.
